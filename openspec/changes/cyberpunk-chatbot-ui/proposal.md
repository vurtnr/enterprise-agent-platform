## Why

The current client UI is functional but visually generic, which makes the chatbot feel less engaging than modern AI assistants. A Gemini-inspired, cyberpunk-leaning interface will improve perceived product quality and make long chat sessions easier to navigate.

## What Changes

- Refresh the client chat UI with a dark, neon-accented visual system aligned to Gemini-inspired layout patterns.
- Add a left sidebar that supports “New Chat” and chat history navigation.
- Establish consistent typography, color, and spacing tokens for the chatbot surface.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `chat-ui-theme-refresh`: A new cyberpunk-leaning visual theme for the client chat experience.
- `chat-history-sidebar`: Sidebar UI for starting new conversations and switching between past chats.

### Modified Capabilities
- None.

## Impact

- Affects frontend UI in `client/src/` (layout, components, styles).
- No API changes expected; backend endpoints remain the same.
- Requires design updates for typography and color usage in the client.
